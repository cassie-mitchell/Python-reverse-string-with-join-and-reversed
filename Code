s = input("Enter your string: ") #request user input
s1 = ''.join(reversed(s)) #the reversed method creates a reversed iterator. The join method connects each character in the string by inserting '' in between - ie nothing in between. Thus the characters are iterated through backwards and joined together with nothing seperating them
print("The reversed string is: " +s1) #print output to console
